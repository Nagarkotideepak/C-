/*
All Years which are perfectly divisible by 4 are leap years except for 
century years(years ending with 00) which is leap year 
only it is perfectly divisible by 400.
For example, 2012,2004,1968,etc. are leap year but, 1971,2006, etc are not leap year.
Similarly, 1200, 1600,2000,2400 are leap years but, 1700, 1800, 1900, etc are not.
