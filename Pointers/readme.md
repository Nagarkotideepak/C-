## Pointers
* Pointer is a address Variable.
* It can store the address of Data
* Pointer are used for accessing heap memory
* Five Arithmetic operations are allowed Pointer
    * p++ => move pointer to next element
    * p-- => move pointer to previous element
    * p+k => gives address of kth element from pointer location to right
    * p-k gives address of kth element from pointer location left
    * q-p gives number of elements between two pointers p and q
* Pointers can be of many levels
* Double Pointer is used for accessing 2D arrays
